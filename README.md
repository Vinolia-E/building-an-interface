# Building Interface

*This document provides a comprehensive guide for designing, developing, and testing a high-fidelity prototype for an e-commerce application focused on second-hand electronic devices. The project aims to create a user-centered, polished prototype that reflects thoughtful design principles and usability.
Deliverables

1. Style Guide

Develop a foundational visual identity for the app:

   * A Figma moodboard including:
     *   Images representing the app’s tone and values.
      *  A color palette with 2–3 primary colors.
       * Typography applied to:
           * Titles
           * Subtitles or descriptions
           * Body content
           * Buttons

2. Design System Library

Create a reusable design system that ensures consistency and scalability:

    * A library of at least 30 elements, including:
       * Atoms: Fundamental building blocks such as  colors, icons, and text styles.
        * Molecules: Combinations of atoms, e.g., buttons with icons or input fields with labels.
        Organisms: Complex components made of multiple molecules, e.g., navigation menus or product cards.
       * Multistate Variations: Interactive states such as hover, active, or disabled.

3. High-Fidelity Screens

* Design a set of high-fidelity screens showcasing the app's core user flow:

    Homepage,
    Content browsing,
    Product details page,
    Shopping cart,
    Checkout.

These screens should reflect the design system and include consistent styling, layout, and functionality.

4. Animated Prototype

Develop an interactive prototype that incorporates smooth animations and multistate interactions:

    Include transitions, button click animations, and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
    Ensure animations are intuitive and aligned with user expectations.

5. Desirability Testing

Conduct a desirability test to validate the app’s values and overall impression:

    Create a board with 25+ adjectives, including 2–5 adjectives that represent the app’s intended values.
    Present the design to participants and collect feedback based on their adjective selection.
    Provide a report summarizing the results and, if necessary, suggest refinements to the design.

## **Usage**
